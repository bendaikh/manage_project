# Delivery Invoice Feature

## Overview

This feature adds an "Invoice Delivery" button to the Delivery page that generates and downloads a PDF invoice containing all orders with 'Delivered' status that were delivered today.

## How It Works

1. **Button Location**: The "Invoice Delivery" button appears at the top of the orders table on the Delivery page only
2. **Data Filtering**: The system automatically filters for:
   - Orders with status 'Delivered'
   - Orders updated today (based on `updated_at` timestamp)
3. **PDF Generation**: Creates a comprehensive invoice PDF with order details

## Implementation Details

  - Added "Invoice Delivery" button (only visible on delivery page)
  - Updated status display to include "Delivered" status with blue styling

### Backend Changes

- **PdfController::deliveryInvoice()**: New method that:
